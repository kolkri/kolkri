### Hello World, I'm Kristiina 👋 Frontend developer with passion for creativity and logical problem solving 💙 


#**Background in energy engineering 🌱** - I have a master degree in energy engineering and I worked several years during my studies and after graduation in the electric utilities sector. Therefore I have strong background in tech and analytical mindset. 

#**Current frontend developer 👩‍💻** - Life happened and I started to think what I actually want to do in life. I knew it is something to do with tech but I was still looking for that position, which really would give my creativity and passion to flow. I had couple of coding courses in university (Python & C progarmming), and I really remember how I enjoyed the logical problem solving aspects of coding. I ran into a swedish coding school Technigo, which is providing web development boot camps. I joined their **frontend development bootcamp spring '22** and fell in love with coding again.
